The gain knowledge in this exercise is to understand the object called localStorage. This storage can save data in your local browser storage that can't be removed even if you refresh or close your website. I also learned about eventListener, which can catch your action on your website, and also the sessionStorage, which is almost like a session in PHP, where the difference is where it is stored.</p>
