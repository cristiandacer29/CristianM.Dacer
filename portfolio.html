It took me almost 2 months to finish this design because I have 0 knowledge of Adobe Illustrator, so I needed to study first.</p>

The linear search is an algorithm that finds data by index in succession, from index 0 to the max index. Binary search works by repeatedly dividing a problem into two smaller sub problems. This is used to refresh my knowledge in programming.</p>

The gain knowledge in this exercise is to understand the object called localStorage. This storage can save data in your local browser storage that can't be removed even if you refresh or close your website. I also learned about eventListener, which can catch your action on your website, and also the sessionStorage, which is almost like a session in PHP, where the difference is where it is stored.</p>

It is composed of some basic problems that can be use to know or to understand the concept or foundation of programming. I am adding this exercise to my portfolio to show to you my understanding of programming.</p>
